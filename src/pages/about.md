**Hi, I'm john. For several years I have become addicted to sharing information. First I started as a Google Guide. And after less than a year, I had over 1 million views on my photos in google maps. Shortly after my start I also started to google street view to share even more information.**

**I had been active on Twitter for years and I didn't do much with Instagram. Now that I share my information on many platforms, it seems like a kind of addiction.**

**But long story short, what is my goal? I love the 4 million views on google per year and the million views on my Twitter accounts together but .... there is always only one. How about a million views total per month. Wouldn't that be great?**

**As a volunteer, I share and also write for a few websites. These are (partly) from my wife and friends. So I will count these views.**
